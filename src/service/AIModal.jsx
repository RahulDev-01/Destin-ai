I've started investigating budget-friendly hotels in Las Vegas for a couple, focusing on off-Strip options to save money. I'm leveraging Google to find suitable accommodations. Subsequently, I plan to delve deeper into each hotel, researching amenities and reviews.

**Gathering Vegas Details**

I'm now deep-diving into the initial hotel leads, pulling data like addresses, prices, and imagery from Google. Simultaneously, I'm researching free and cheap couple-friendly activities and cost-effective dining options to incorporate into the itinerary. Next, I'll structure a cost-conscious 3-day plan, taking location and time of day into account.

**Exploring Hotel Options**

I've initially identified a solid range of budget-friendly hotels in Las Vegas, suitable for couples. These include selections on and off the Strip, as well as Downtown. I have since compiled more data.

**Gathering Specific Hotel Data**

I've made headway on the hotel search. I've narrowed down a list of budget-friendly options, but I still need to find precise addresses, image URLs, and geo-coordinates. The current results give a good starting point, but I must make targeted searches to find this information. I also need to focus on those hotels that are both affordable and suited for a couple. After that, I will work on the itinerary and the final JSON format.`,
