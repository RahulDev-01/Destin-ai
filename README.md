### Key Features & How It Works

#### 1. **AI-Powered Destination Recommendations** 🌍

The core feature of the Destin-Ai is its ability to recommend destinations based on your travel preferences. Whether you're looking for beach vacations, cultural experiences, or adventure trips, the app uses intelligent algorithms to suggest the best places that match your criteria. You can specify factors such as:

* Budget 💰
* Weather preferences 🌞🌧️
* Travel style (e.g., relaxation, adventure, exploration) 🏖️🧗
* Seasonality and travel dates 📅

#### 2. **Custom Itinerary Creation** 🗓️

Once you’ve selected your destination(s), the app generates a customized itinerary based on your trip details. It factors in the best activities, local attractions, and travel routes, creating an itinerary that aligns with your preferences. You can modify the itinerary as needed, adding or removing activities to fit your needs.

#### 3. **Real-Time Trip Management** 📍

After creating your trip, you can view and manage the details of your travel plans in one place. The **My Trips** page gives you an overview of all your trips and allows you to click into individual trips to see detailed information. You can track your itinerary, make changes, and check off activities as you go ✅.

#### 4. **Google OAuth Authentication** 🔑

Sign up and log in securely with **Google OAuth** integration. This allows you to access your trip data across devices and store your travel plans securely without the need to manage additional credentials. With a single click, you can save, modify, and access your trips from anywhere 🌐.

#### 5. **Mobile-Friendly Design** 📱

The application is fully responsive, ensuring that it works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Whether you're planning your trip on your laptop at home 💻 or modifying your itinerary while on the go 🏞️, the app adapts to your device's screen size for an optimal experience.

#### 6 . **Toast Notifications for Real-Time Feedback** 📢

Instant feedback is crucial when interacting with the app. The app integrates **Sonner** for toast notifications to alert users of important actions, such as successfully creating a trip or an error in submitting a form ⚠️. These small but useful alerts improve the user experience and ensure you’re always in the know 📬.
